## What you'll need ️🛠️: iTerm2

### Node.js

Being a part of our Node.js circle requires you to have ... well, Node.js 😅.
But to get Node.js we'll start by setting up your terminal and installing Homebrew 🍺, a popular package manager for MacOS.

### Installing iTerm2

The unleash your full hacker-man potential 😎 we'll install [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) to replace the default MacOS terminal.

1. **Install iTerm2**:  
  Download the latest version of iTerm2 from [https://iterm2.com](https://iterm2.com).


2. **Install Oh My Zsh**:  
  [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) brings a lot of new goodies and allows for better completion on commands through plugins.  
  Open Term2 and run the following command:
    ```bash
    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
    ```
    This command will download and install Oh My Zsh and set Zsh as your default shell.


3. **Install the recommend fonts**:

    Download each file. Double-click on each file followed by clicking on "Install". This will make `MesloLGS NF` font available to all applications on your system.
   - [MesloLGS NF Regular.ttf](
     https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Regular.ttf)
   - [MesloLGS NF Bold.ttf](
     https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Bold.ttf)
   - [MesloLGS NF Italic.ttf](
     https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Italic.ttf)
   - [MesloLGS NF Bold Italic.ttf](
     https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Bold%20Italic.ttf)

   

4. **Install Powerlevel10k**:  
    Run the following command:  
    ```bash
    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
    ```

    Add or change the line `ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"` in `~/.zshrc`  
    Restart Zsh with `exec zsh`.


5. **Configure Powerlevel10k**:  
   Run the following command:
    ```bash
    p10k configure
    ```
    This command will start the configuration wizard. Follow the instructions to customize your prompt.

_To complete your hacker man arc try out some definitely useful tools like lolcat and cowsay.
Be sure to share any other essential tools for iTerm overlords you know of 👑_

## What you'll need ️🛠️: Homebrew 🍺
### Installing Homebrew 🍺

1. **Install Homebrew** (if not already installed)   
   Open a terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Update Homebrew**: Before installing any packages, it's a good idea to update Homebrew to the latest version. Run the following command to do so:

   ```bash
   brew update
   ```

_Did you know that our circle lead also home brews his own beers?_ 😋🍺

## What you'll need ️🛠️: Node.js 
### Installing Node.js

1. **Install Node.js**:  
   Now that Homebrew is installed and updated, you can install Node.js by running the following command:

   ```bash
   brew install node
   ```

   This command will install the latest stable version of Node.js on your system.  
  Verify your installation with:
  
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

   If both commands return version numbers, Node.js and npm are installed successfully.


2. **Install pnpm**:  
    We use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as our package manager for Node.js. To install pnpm, run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

   This command will install the latest version of pnpm and make it available system-wide.


3. **Install TypeScript**:   
   We use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) as our programming language. To install TypeScript, run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript
   ```  
    This command will install the latest version of TypeScript and make it available system-wide.  
    Verify your typescript installation with:
    
     ```bash
     tsc --version
     ```
    
    If the command returns a version number, TypeScript is installed correctly.

## What you'll need ️🛠️: VCS
### Version Control

#### Git 
Our preferred version control system at Wisemen.  
It should come preinstalled on your mac. You can verify your installation with:
```bash
git -v
```

#### Github

We use Github (and previously [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/appwise/workspace/overview)) as our repository hosting service.  
Your future projects will be hosted on Github. So be sure to link your Wisemen work email to your personal github account our make a new work account before continuing.  
If you have not received an invite for the Wisemen github organisation be sure to ask your budy about it.

[Wisemen Github](https://github.com/wisemen-digital)

Here is great article to get you started with github:
[Github Git tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world)   🤓  
It also teaches you how to create **pull requests**, so keep this tab open for when you make your first pull request 🤞. 

_I can't see the main for the branches anymore_ 😵‍💫

## What you'll need ️🛠️: IDE

There are 2 different IDEs in use at Wisemen. You can use either **Visual Studio Code** or **WebStorm**.

#### Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is an editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.
It includes support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.

_If there's one thing the world needs, it's more todo apps!_ 👍


## Project setup

### 1. Fork the Wisemen NestJS Template from Github

You can kickstart your new project without starting from square one by using the [Wisemen NestJS Template Project](https://github.com/wisemen-digital/nestjs-template). This repository already includes authentication and a user entity, providing a solid foundation for your project. If at any point you are stuck, take a peek into the auth of user module, you might find great examples there!
Fork this project into your own repository on Github.

### 2. Package.json

The package.json file is used manage the project's dependencies and predefined run commands.

```json
{
  "name": "nestjs-example",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "",
  "author": "",
  "private": true,
  "license": "UNLICENSED",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "clean": "rm -rf ./dist",
    "build": "nest build",
    "format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.ts\" \"test/**/*.ts\"",
    "start": "node dist/src/main.js",
    ...
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@appwise/express-dto-router": "^1.1.5",
    "@appwise/oauth2-server": "^0.0.10",
    "@appwise/transformer": "^0.0.2",
    "@nestjs/common": "^10.2.4",
    ...
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@nestjs/cli": "^10.1.17",
    "@nestjs/schematics": "^10.0.2",
    "@nestjs/testing": "^10.2.4",
    "@sentry/types": "^7.37.1",
    ...
  }
}

```

#### 2.1 Scripts

The scripts property is used to specify a list of scripts that can be run using `pnpm script-name`.
It's written as a JSON object where each key is the name of a script and the value is the command to execute.
Most common scripts are `start` and `build`.

#### 2.2 Dependencies

Install the dependencies specified in package.json file by running:
```bash
pnpm install
```

**Dev dependencies** are dependencies that are only used during development and are not required for production.  
**Dependencies** are required for production.


### 3. Environment variables

#### Generating RSA keys

To generate the RSA keys execute the following in at your project folder:

   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 2048
   openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
   cat private.pem | base64 '<-- Your RSA_PRIVATE'
   cat public.pem | base64 '<-- Your RSA_PUBLIC'
   ```
_Note: during private generation a passphrase is required, this is RSA_PASSPHRASE_



Create an .env file and add the following:

```dotenv
TYPEORM_URI = postgresql://postgres:password@127.0.0.1:5432/todo # PSQL link
REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME = 300 # 5 minutes
RSA_PRIVATE = "your private key"
RSA_PUBLIC = "your public key"
RSA_PASSPHRASE = "your password
```

### 4. PostGis Database Setup

#### Requirements
1. Docker Desktop
2. Install TablePlus through Setapp

#### Docker setup

Download and install the requirements above. Once these are installed we can pull the `postgis/postgis` image from the docker website. Open a command tool and execute `docker pull postgis/postgis`. This will download the image which we will use later.

Open the Docker Desktop application and confirm the image has been installed. After the image is installed, we can create a docker container using following command: `docker run --name [NAME] -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=[PASSWORD] -p 5432:5432 -d postgis/postgis`. Confirm that in the Containers / Apps the postgis/postgis container with the name `[NAME]` is running. We can now setup different databases using following command which will open the psql CLI: `docker exec -ti [NAME] psql -U postgres`. After we are in the CLI, we can configure the databases: `CREATE DATABASE [database_name];` (notice the ; at the end) To check if the database has been created, execute the `\l` command in the CLI, this will list all the databases available. To exit the CLI, type `quit`.

#### Connecting with TablePlus
(TablePlus can be downloaded though SetApp)

Open TablePlus, click on 'create new connection' and select PostgreSQL. <br />
Name: `any` <br />
Host/Socket : `localhost` <br />
Port: `5432` <br />
User: `postgres` <br />
Password: `[PASSWORD]` <br />
Database: `[database_name]`<br />

### 5. First Start 🚀

Now try to run your first project with `pnpm start:dev`

```
if (errors.length() === 0) {
   proceedToNextChapter()
} else {
   askBuddyForHelp()
}
```

## Project Structure

### Folder structure

For this project we will be using a ‘split-by-feature' folder structure.

```
- src
   - modules
      - ...
      - users
         - controllers
            - user.controller.ts

## PROJECT: Overview
Welcome to the Todo App Backend Codelab! In this codelab, you will be building a backend for a todo app. The goal is to create a robust backend system that allows users to perform CRUD operations on todo items. The development process is divided into several steps to guide you through building the essential components of the application.

### Project Description
The Todo App Backend is a simple backend system that provides a RESTful API for managing todo items. The backend system includes the following features:

- **Create a Todo**: Users can create a new todo item with a title, description, and deadline.
- **Get All Todos**: Users can retrieve a list of all todo items of the authenticated user.
- **Get a Todo**: Users can retrieve a specific todo item by its unique identifier.
- **Update a Todo**: Users can update the title, description, and deadline of a todo item.
- **Delete a Todo**: Users can delete a todo item by its unique identifier.
- **Complete a Todo**: Users can mark a todo item as completed.
- **Uncomplete a Todo**: Users can mark a completed todo item as uncompleted.


### Project Structure

The project is organized into the following components:

1. **Entity**: Define the data structure for a todo item.

2. **DTO (Data Transfer Object) and Transformer**: Create DTOs to transfer data between layers and transformers to convert to the correct response

3. **Controller**: Implement the API controllers to handle incoming requests and interact with the service layer.

4. **Module**: Organize the components into a module to encapsulate the related functionality.

5. **Tests**: Write comprehensive tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of your code.

6. **Service and Repository**: Develop the service layer to handle business logic and the repository layer to interact with the database.

7. **Documentation**: Document your API endpoints to make it easy for others to use your backend.

Before you begin, make sure you have the necessary tools and dependencies installed. Refer to step 4 in the guide for instructions on setting up your development environment.

Now, let's dive into building the Todo App Backend!

Happy coding!

## PROJECT: Entity

Entities are used to define the data structure for a todo item. In this project, you will define a Todo entity that represents the structure of a todo item.

### Entity Definition
The Todo entity is a simple data structure that represents a todo item. It includes the following fields:

- **uuid**: A unique identifier for the todo item.
- **title**: The title of the todo item.
- **description**: A nullable description for the todo item.
- **deadline**: A nullable deadline for the todo item.
- **completed**: A boolean value indicating whether the todo item is completed (default: false).

To view all possible column types using Typeorm with Postgresql, see [docs](https://orkhan.gitbook.io/typeorm/docs/entities#column-types)

### Entity Setup
To define the Todo entity, you will create a new file called `todo.entity.ts` in the `src/modules/todo/entities` folder and define the Todo class with the specified fields.

```typescript
// src/modules/todo/entities/todo.entity.ts

import { Column, CreateDateColumn, DeleteDateColumn, Entity, Index, ManyToOne, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, UpdateDateColumn } from 'typeorm'

@Entity()
export class Todo {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn('uuid')
  uuid: string

  @CreateDateColumn({ precision: 3 })
  createdAt: Date

  @UpdateDateColumn({ precision: 3 })
  updatedAt: Date

  @DeleteDateColumn({ precision: 3 })
  deletedAt: Date

  @Column({ type: 'varchar' })
  title: string

  @Column({ type: 'varchar', nullable: true })
  description: string | null

  @Column({ type: 'timestamp', precision: 3, nullable: true })
  deadline: Date | null

  @Column({ type: 'boolean', default: false })
  completed: boolean
}
```

In the code above, you define the Todo entity using the `@Entity` decorator from TypeORM. The Todo class includes the `uuid`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `deletedAt`, `title`, `description`, `deadline` , and `completed` fields, which map to the corresponding columns in the database table.

### Entity Relations
Now the Todo entity has no relation with any other entity, but we want to "attach" the todo's to an user. This we can do with entity relations.

To create a relation between the Todo and User entities, you can use the `@ManyToOne` decorator to define a many-to-one relationship between the two entities.

```typescript
// src/modules/todo/entities/todo.entity.ts

import { Column, CreateDateColumn, DeleteDateColumn, Entity, Index, ManyToOne, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, UpdateDateColumn } from 'typeorm'
import { User } from '../../user/entities/user.entity'

@Entity()
export class Todo {
  // ... other fields

  @Column({ type: 'uuid' })
  @Index()
  userUuid: string

  @ManyToOne(() => User, user => user.todos)
  @JoinColumn({ name: 'userUuid' })
  user?: Relation<User>
}
```

In the code above, you define a many-to-one relationship between the Todo and User entities using the `@ManyToOne` decorator. The `@ManyToOne` decorator takes two arguments:

- The first argument is a function that returns the entity class of the related entity (User).
- The second argument is a function that returns the property of the related entity that represents the inverse side of the relationship (todos).

Now you need to add a one-to-many relationship to the User entity to complete the bidirectional relationship.

```typescript
// src/modules/user/entities/user.entity.ts

import { Column, CreateDateColumn, DeleteDateColumn, Entity, Index, OneToMany, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, UpdateDateColumn } from 'typeorm'
import { Todo } from '../../todo/entities/todo.entity'

@Entity()
export class User {
  // ... other fields

  @OneToMany(() => Todo, todo => todo.user)
  todos?: Array<Relation<Todo>>
}
```

In the code above, you define a one-to-many relationship between the User and Todo entities using the `@OneToMany` decorator. The `@OneToMany` decorator takes two arguments:

- The first argument is a function that returns the entity class of the related entity (Todo).
- The second argument is a function that returns the property of the related entity that represents the inverse side of the relationship (user).

Now the Todo entity has a many-to-one relationship with the User entity, and the User entity has a one-to-many relationship with the Todo entity, completing the bidirectional relationship.

### Create migration

After defining the Todo entity and its relation with the User entity, you need to create a migration to apply the changes to the database schema.

First import your entity in the `models.ts` file in the `src/config/sql/models` folder.

Next, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm typeorm migration:generate src/config/sql/migrations/CreateTodoEntity
```

This command creates a new migration file with the name `CreateTodoEntity.ts`. Add the generated migration class to the `mainMigrations` in the `index.ts` file.

💡Don't forget to make a pull request of your work so your buddy can review your code and keep track of your progress. Keeping your PR's small and frequent is a good practice.

## PROJECT: DTO & Transformer (and documentation)
### Data Transfer Object (DTO)
Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) are used to defines how the data will be sent over the network. The DTOs will validate the data and transform it to the correct format before sending it to the controller.

First we will create a DTO for creating a todo item. Create a new file called `create-todo.dto.ts` in the `src/modules/todo/dtos` folder and define the CreateTodoDto class with the specified fields.

```typescript
// src/modules/todo/dtos/create-todo.dto.ts

import { IsDateString, IsNotEmpty, IsString } from 'class-validator'
import { IsNullable } from '../../../util/validators/is-nullable.validator.js'

export class CreateTodoDto {
  @IsNotEmpty()
  title: string

  @IsString()
  @IsNullable()
  description: string | null

  @IsDateString({ strict: true })
  @IsNullable()
  deadline: Date | null
}
```

In the code above, you define the CreateTodoDto class with the `title`, `description`, and `deadline` fields. The `@IsNotEmpty` decorator is used to validate that the `title` field is not empty, and the `@IsString` decorator is used to validate that the `description` field is a string. The `@IsDateString` decorator is used to validate that the `deadline` field is a valid date string. The `@IsNullable` decorator is used to allow the `description` and `deadline` fields to be nullable.

To view all possible decorators using class-validator, see [docs](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator)

For the update call we will use the same DTO, because we only want to update the title, description and deadline.


💡Don't forget to make a pull request of your work so your buddy can review your code and keep track of your progress. Keeping your PR's small and frequent is a good practice.

### Transformer
Transformers are used to convert the data to the correct format before sending the response to the client. In this project, you will define a TodoTransformer to transform the todo item to the correct format before sending it to the client.

First we will create a transformer and transformer type for the todo item. Create a new file called `todo.transformer.ts` in the `src/modules/todo/transformers` folder and define the TodoTransformer class with the specified fields.

```typescript
// src/modules/todo/transformers/todo.transformer.ts

import { Todo } from '../entities/todo.entity'
import { Transformer } from '@appwise/transformer'

export class TodoTransformerType {
   uuid: string
   createdAt: Date
   updatedAt: Date
   title: string
   description: string | null
   deadline: string | null
   completed: boolean
}

export class TodoTransformer extends Transformer<Todo, TodoTransformerType> {
  transform (todo: Todo): TodoTransformerType {
    return {
      uuid: todo.uuid,
      createdAt: todo.createdAt,
      updatedAt: todo.updatedAt,
      title: todo.title,
      description: todo.description,
      deadline: todo.deadline?.toISOString() ?? null,
      completed: todo.completed
    }
  }
}
```

In the code above, you define the TodoTransformer class with the `transform` method that takes a todo item as an argument and returns a transformed todo item in the correct format.

### Documentation
To document the API endpoints, you will use the `@ApiProperty` decorator from the `@nestjs/swagger` package to define the request and response schemas for the API endpoints.

First we will edit the `create-todo.dto.ts` file in the `src/modules/todo/dtos` folder and add the `@ApiProperty` decorator to the `CreateTodoDto` class to define the request schema for the create todo endpoint.

```typescript
// src/modules/todo/dtos/create-todo.dto.ts

import { ApiProperty } from '@nestjs/swagger'
import { IsDateString, IsNotEmpty, IsString } from 'class-validator'
import { IsNullable } from '../../../util/validators/is-nullable.validator'

export class CreateTodoDto {
  @ApiProperty()
  @IsNotEmpty()
  title: string

  @ApiProperty({ type: String, nullable: true })
  @IsString()
  @IsNullable()
  description: string | null

  @ApiProperty({ type: String, format: 'date-time', nullable: true })
  @IsDateString({ strict: true })
  @IsNullable()
  deadline: string | null
}
```

Second we will edit the `todo.transformer.ts` file in the `src/modules/todo/transformers` folder and add the `@ApiProperty` decorator to the `TodoTransformerType` class to define the response schema for the todo item.

```typescript
// src/modules/todo/transformers/todo.transformer.ts

import { ApiProperty } from '@nestjs/swagger'
import { Todo } from '../entities/todo.entity'
import { Transformer } from '@appwise/express-dto-router'

export class TodoTransformerType {
  @ApiProperty()
  uuid: string

  @ApiProperty()
  createdAt: Date

  @ApiProperty()
  updatedAt: Date

  @ApiProperty()
  title: string

  @ApiProperty({ type: String, nullable: true })
  description: string | null

  @ApiProperty({ type: String, format: 'date-time', nullable: true })
  deadline: Date | null

  @ApiProperty()
  completed: boolean
}

// ... other code
```

In the code above, you define the request and response schemas for the create todo endpoint using the `@ApiProperty` decorator. The `@ApiProperty` decorator takes an optional argument to define the type, format, and nullable properties of the schema.

💡Don't forget to make a pull request of your work so your buddy can review your code and keep track of your progress. Keeping your PR's small and frequent is a good practice.

## PROJECT: Controller

Controllers are used to handle incoming requests and interact with the service layer to process the data. In this project, you will define a TodoController to handle the CRUD operations for the todo items.

### Controller Definition
The TodoController is a class that defines the API endpoints for the todo items. It includes the following methods to handle the CRUD operations for the todo items:

- **createTodo**: Create a new todo item.
- **getTodos**: Retrieve a list of all todo items.
- **getTodo**: Retrieve a specific todo item by its unique identifier.
- **updateTodo**: Update the title, description, and deadline of a todo item.
- **deleteTodo**: Delete a todo item by its unique identifier.
- **completeTodo**: Mark a todo item as completed.
- **uncompleteTodo**: Mark a completed todo item as uncompleted.

First we will create a new file called `todo.controller.ts` in the `src/modules/todo/controllers` folder and define the TodoController class with the specified methods.

```typescript
// src/modules/todo/controllers/todo.controller.ts

import { Body, Controller, Get, Param, ParseUUIDPipe, Post } from '@nestjs/common'
import { ApiResponse, ApiTags } from '@nestjs/swagger'
import { CreateTodoDto } from '../dtos/create-todo.dto.js'
import { TodoTransformerType } from '../transformers/todo.transformer.js'
import { UserTransformerType } from '../../users/transformers/user.transformer.js'
import { KnownError } from '../../../utils/Exceptions/errors.js'

@ApiTags('Todo')
@Controller('todos')
export class TodoController {

  @Post()
  @ApiResponse({
    status: 201,
    description: 'The todo has been successfully created.',
    type: TodoTransformerType
  })
  async createTodo (
    @Body() createTodoDto: CreateTodoDto,
  ): Promise<void> {
    throw new KnownError('not_found')
  }

  @Get(':todo')
  @ApiResponse({
    status: 200,
    description: 'The todo has been successfully received.',
    type: UserTransformerType
  })
  async getTodo (
    @Param('todo', ParseUUIDPipe) todoUuid: string
  ): Promise<void> {
    throw new KnownError('not_found')
  }

}

```

In the code above, you define the TodoController class with the `createTodo` and `getTodo` methods to handle the create and get operations for the todo items.

The `@Post` and `@Get` decorators are used to define the API endpoints for the create and get operations, and the `@ApiResponse` decorator is used to define the response schema for the API endpoints.

The `@Body` and `@Param` decorators are used to extract the request body and URL parameters from the incoming requests.

The `ParseUUIDPipe` is used to validate and parse the UUID parameter from the URL, more info about pipes can be found [here](https://docs.nestjs.com/pipes).

For now we use `Promise&lt;void&gt;` as return type, but we will change this later to the correct return type once we have the service and repository setup.

Also see the [NestJs documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/controllers) for more information about controllers.

### Authentication

We should prevent unauthenticated users from accessing certain endpoints of our API. In our project template, we already built the logic that will help us protect our endpoints. Have a look into `app.module.ts`, you'll see that we defined some global guards that will protect all endpoints in our application.

Furthermore, have a look into the auth and user module, where all the authentication and user management logic is built.

Also see the [NestJs documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/security/authentication) for more information about security and authentication.

### Your turn!

Now create the other methods for the controller!

## PROJECT: Module

Modules are used to organize the components of the application into cohesive units. In this project, you will define a TodoModule to encapsulate the related functionality for the todo items.

### Module Definition

The TodoModule is a class that defines the components of the application related to the todo items. It includes the following components:

- **Entity**: Define the data structure for a todo item.
- **Controller**: Define the controller for handling the CRUD operations for the todo items.
- **Service**: Define the service for handling the business logic for the todo items.
- **Repository**: Define the repository for interacting with the database for the todo items.

First we will create a new file called `todo.module.ts` in the `src/modules/todo` folder and define the TodoModule class with the specified components.

```typescript
// src/modules/todo/todo.module.ts

import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { TypeOrmModule } from '@nestjs/typeorm'
import { Todo } from './entities/todo.entity.js'
import { TodoController } from './controllers/todo.controller.js'

@Module({
  imports: [TypeOrmModule.forFeature([Todo])],
  controllers: [TodoController],
  providers: [],
  exports: []
})
export class TodoModule {}
```

In the code above, you define the TodoModule class with the `imports`, `controllers`, `providers`, and `exports` properties. The `imports` property is used to import the TypeOrmModule to provide the Todo entity to the application. The `controllers` property is used to define the TodoController as a controller for the TodoModule. The `providers` and `exports` properties are used to define the service and repository components for the TodoModule.

Also see the [NestJs documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/modules) for more information about modules.

After defining the TodoModule, you need to import the TodoModule into the root application module (`src/app.module.ts`) to make it available to the application. Now when you run the application (`pnpm start:dev`), the TodoModule will be loaded and the TodoController will be available to handle the API requests for the todo items and the documentation will be available in the [Swagger UI](http://localhost:3000/api).

💡Don't forget to make a pull request of your work so your buddy can review your code and keep track of your progress. Keeping your PR's small and frequent is a good practice.

## PROJECT: Repository

Repositories are used to interact with the database for the application. In this project, you will define a TodoRepository to interact with the database for the todo items.

### Repository Definition

The TodoRepository is a class that defines the methods to interact with the database for the todo items.

First we will create a new file called `todo.repository.ts` in the `src/modules/todo/repositories` folder and define the TodoRepository class with the specified methods.

```typescript
import { EntityManager, Repository } from 'typeorm'
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common'
import { InjectEntityManager } from '@nestjs/typeorm'
import { Todo } from '../entities/todo.entity.js'

@Injectable()
export class TodoRepository extends Repository<Todo> {
  constructor (@InjectEntityManager() entityManager: EntityManager) {
    super(Todo, entityManager)
  }
}
```

In the code above, you define the TodoRepository class that extends the Repository class from TypeORM. The TodoRepository class includes the `constructor` method to inject the EntityManager and call the super constructor with the Todo entity and the EntityManager. This allows you to use the methods provided by the Repository class to interact with the database for the todo items. You can add custom methods to the TodoRepository class to handle the specific database operations for the todo items, like find all todos of a user, find a todo by its uuid, etc.

💡Don't forget to make a pull request of your work so your buddy can review your code and keep track of your progress. Keeping your PR's small and frequent is a good practice.

## PROJECT: Testing

At Wisemen we work with [test driven development](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html). This means that we write tests before we write the actual code. This way we can make sure that the code we write is working as expected.

### E2E Testing
End-to-end (E2E) testing is a software testing method that tests the entire software application from start to finish. The purpose of E2E testing is to simulate real user scenarios and validate the system's integration with external interfaces.

First we will create a new file called `todo.e2e.test.ts` in the `src/modules/todo/tests` folder and define the TodoE2eTest class with the specified tests.

```typescript
// src/modules/todo/tests/todo.e2e.test.ts
import { expect } from 'expect'
import { before, describe, it, after } from 'node:test'
import { ValidationPipe, type INestApplication } from '@nestjs/common'
import { Test } from '@nestjs/testing'
import request from 'supertest'
import { HttpAdapterHost } from '@nestjs/core'
import { HttpExceptionFilter } from '../../../utils/Exceptions/http-exception.filter.js'
import { AppModule } from '../../../app.module.js'
import { UserSeeder } from '../../user/tests/user.seeder.js'
import { UserSeederModule } from '../../user/tests/user-seeder.module.js'


describe('Todo tests', async () => {
  let app: INestApplication
  let userSeeder: UserSeeder

  before(async () => {
    const moduleRef = await Test.createTestingModule({
      imports: [
        AppModule,
        UserSeederModule
      ]
    }).compile()

    app = moduleRef.createNestApplication()
    app.useGlobalPipes(
      new ValidationPipe({
        whitelist: true,
        forbidNonWhitelisted: true,
        transform: true,
        transformOptions: {
          enableImplicitConversion: true
        }
      })
    )

    const httpAdapterHost = app.get(HttpAdapterHost)

    app.useGlobalFilters(new HttpExceptionFilter(httpAdapterHost))

    userSeeder = moduleRef.get(UserSeeder)

    await app.init()
  })

  after(async () => {
    await app.close()
  })

})
```

In the above code, you define the TodoE2eTest class with the `before` and `after` hooks to set up and tear down the application for the tests. The `before` hook is used to create the application instance and set up the global pipes and filters, and the `after` hook is used to close the application instance after the tests are completed.

Now you need to add the tests for the create, get, update, delete, complete, and uncomplete operations for the todo items. In our tests we will check the following cases:

- **Unauthenticated**: Test the API endpoints without authentication.
- **Unauthorized**: Test the API endpoints with an unauthorized user.
- **Invalid Input**: Test the API endpoints with invalid input data.
- **Valid Input**: Test the API endpoints with valid input data.

```typescript
// src/modules/todo/tests/todo.e2e.test.ts

// ... setup

describe('Create todo', () => {
    it('should return 401 when not authenticated', async () => {
      const response = await request(app.getHttpServer())
        .post('/todos')

      expect(response.status).toBe(401)
    })

    it('should return 401 when not authorized', async () => {
      const { token } = await userSeeder.unAuthorizedUser()

      const response = await request(app.getHttpServer())
        .post('/todos')
        .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`)
        .send({})

      expect(response.status).toBe(400)
    })

    it('should return 400 when body is empty', async () => {
      const { token } = await userSeeder.setupUser()

      const response = await request(app.getHttpServer())
        .post('/todos')
        .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`)
        .send({})

      expect(response.status).toBe(400)
    })

    it('should return 201', async () => {
      const dto = todoSeeder.generateCreateTodoDto()

      const { token } = await userSeeder.setupUser()

      const response = await request(app.getHttpServer())
        .post('/todos')
        .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`)
        .send(dto)

      expect(response.status).toBe(201)
    })
  })

   // ... other tests

```

In the above code, you can see we use Seeders to create the user and todo items for the tests. The `userSeeder` and `todoSeeder` are used to create the user and todo items with the specified data for the tests. The `generateCreateTodoDto` method is used to generate the create todo DTO with the specified data for the tests. In the following chapters we will create the seeders and the DTO generator.

### Seeder
Seeders are used to create the data for the tests. In this project, you will define a TodoSeeder to create the todo items for the tests.

First we will create a new file called `todo.seeder.ts` in the `src/modules/todo/tests` folder and define the TodoSeeder class with the specified methods.

```typescript
// src/modules/todo/tests/todo.seeder.ts

import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common'
import { type CreateTodoDto } from '../dtos/create-todo.dto.js'

@Injectable()
export class TodoSeeder {
    constructor(
    private readonly todoRepository: TodoRepository
  ) {}
  
  generateCreateTodoDto (userUuid: string): CreateTodoDto {
    return {
      userUuid,
      title: 'Test todo',
      description: 'Test description',
      deadline: new Date().toISOString()
    }
  }

  async createOneTodo (userUuid: string): Promise<Todo> {
    return await this.todoRepository.save(this.generateCreateTodoDto(userUuid))
  }

   // ... other methods
}
```

In the code above, you define the TodoSeeder class with the `generateCreateTodoDto` method to generate the create todo DTO with the specified data for the tests. In this seeder you will also add todo items to the database to use in the tests.

### Test Module

Now you need to create a test module to provide the TodoSeeder to the application for the tests. First we will create a new file called `todo.seeder.module.ts` in the `src/modules/todo/tests` folder and define the TodoSeederModule class with the specified components.

```typescript
// src/modules/todo/tests/todo-seeder.module.ts

import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { TodoSeeder } from './todo.seeder.js'

@Module({
  providers: [TodoSeeder],
  exports: [TodoSeeder]
})
export class TodoSeederModule {}
```

In the code above, you define the TodoSeederModule class with the `providers` and `exports` properties to define the TodoSeeder as a provider and export it to make it available to the application for the tests. Now you need to import the TodoSeederModule into the test module (`src/modules/todo/tests/todo.e2e.test.ts`) to make it available to the application for the tests.

### Running tests

Have a look into the `.env.test` file, this environment file is used when running the tests. Make sure you postgis docker container is running and matches your environment settings.

Now run the tests with `pnpm test`, normally you will see the tests fail because we haven't implemented the methods yet. Now you can start implementing the methods and see the tests pass!

💡Don't forget to make a pull request of your work so your buddy can review your code and keep track of your progress. Keeping your PR's small and frequent is a good practice.

## PROJECT: Service

Services are used to handle the business logic for the application. In this project, you will define a TodoService to handle the CRUD operations for the todo items.

### Service Definition

The TodoService is a class that defines the methods to handle the business logic for the todo items.

First we will create a new file called `todo.service.ts` in the `src/modules/todo/services` folder and define the TodoService class with the specified methods.

```typescript
// src/modules/todo/services/todo.service.ts

import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common'
import { TodoRepository } from '../repositories/todo.repository.js'
import { CreateTodoDto } from '../dtos/create-todo.dto.js'
import { Todo } from '../entities/todo.entity.js'

@Injectable()
export class TodoService {
  constructor (private readonly todoRepository: TodoRepository) {}

  async createTodo (createTodoDto: CreateTodoDto): Promise<Todo> {
    const todo = this.todoRepository.create(createTodoDto)

    return this.todoRepository.save(todo)
  }

  async getTodo (todoUuid: string): Promise<Todo> {
    return await this.todoRepository.findOneOrFail({ where: { uuid: todoUuid } })
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

In the code above, you define the TodoService class with the `createTodo` and `getTodo` methods to handle the create and get operations for the todo items. The `createTodo` method is used to create a new todo item with the specified data, and the `getTodo` method is used to retrieve a specific todo item by its unique identifier. You can add other methods to the TodoService class to handle the update, delete, complete, and uncomplete operations for the todo items.

Add the service and repository as providers to the TodoModule and inject the TodoService into the TodoController to use the methods in the controller. You also need to export the TodoService in the module to make it available to the application.

Now you need to add the methods for the update, delete, complete, and uncomplete operations for the todo items. In these methods you will use the TodoRepository to interact with the database for the todo items.

Regularly run the tests with `pnpm test` to make sure that the methods are working as expected.

Once all methods are implemented and the tests are passing, you can make your final pull request and wait for the final feedback.
